# My Statistics Blog

Welcome to my Statistics Blog.

This blog is a personal space where I publish my statistics homework, research projects, and reflections throughout the semester. It was created as part of my Statistics course at La Sapienza University.

## Purpose

Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. In this blog, I explore how statistics can be applied in practical contexts — especially in cybersecurity, where data-driven decisions are essential to detect threats, predict attacks, and protect systems.

## Blog Structure

- **Home Page:** `index.html` — welcome page with links to all homework and projects.
- **Homework Pages:**
  - `homework1/homework1.html` — What is Statistics and Why Can It Be Useful for Cybersecurity?
  - `homework2/` — folder prepared for next homework (content will be added later).

## Access

The live blog can be viewed here:

## Notes

- All future homework will be added to their respective folders.
- Images, charts, and other resources can be stored in the `images/` folder.
- The blog is built using simple HTML and CSS and hosted with GitHub Pages.
