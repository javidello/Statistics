# My Statistics Blog

Welcome to my Statistics Blog.

This blog is a personal space where I publish my statistics homework, research projects, and reflections throughout the semester. It was created as part of my Statistics course at La Sapienza University.

## Purpose

Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. In this blog, I explore how statistics can be applied in practical contexts — especially in cybersecurity, where data-driven decisions are essential to detect threats, predict attacks, and protect systems.

## Blog Structure

- **Home Page:** [index.html](index.html) — A welcome page with links to all homework and projects.
- **Homework Pages:** Each assignment has its own page:
  - [Homework 1](homework1.html) — *What is Statistics, and Why Can It Be Useful for Cybersecurity?*
  - Future homework assignments will be added here as the course progresses.
